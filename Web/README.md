# Make-A-Pledge - Web

## Installation

```sh
npm install
```

## Build/Assemble

Each page is defined in the `pages/` directory. Some of the assets are however
compiled from other parts of the general project. To gather all required data
you must "build" the web application.

```sh
npm run build
```

## Start Server

Once built, you may serve the web-based content by the following command:

```sh
npm start
```
